# Responsive Images

## Getting Up and Running

### Why Responsive Images?

The goal is to produce the **highest** quality images with the **fewest bytes** possible.

> Images consume more than 60% of the bytes that croess the web.

**NOTE**: Most of the bytes cross the web are for video.

> Create a product, don't re-imagine one for small screens. Greate mobile products are created, never ported.
