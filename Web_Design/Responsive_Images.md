# Responsive Images

## Getting Up and Running

### Why Responsive Images?

The goal is to produce the **highest** quality images with the **fewest bytes** possible.

> Images consume more than 60% of the bytes that croess the web.

**NOTE**: Most of the bytes cross the web are for video.

> Create a product, don't re-imagine one for small screens. Greate mobile products are created, never ported.

**Addtional Note for Chrome Canary**: 

Chrome Canary is the developer version of Chrome. It looks and acts like the regular Chrome browser, but it includes new and experimental features that haven't been released yet. We recommend analyzing websites with Canary to take advantage of the latest tech. However, be warned that Canary isn't guaranteed to be stable, so expect crashes and occasional bugs.
