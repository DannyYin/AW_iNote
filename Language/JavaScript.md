# JavaScript

**JavaScript** was created in May 1995 by Brendan Eich. The original name was **Mocha**, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen. 

## Getting Up and Running

```JavaScript
// print thing on console
console.log("Hello world!");
```

Introducing **jQuery**, read more [here](https://jquery.com/).

JavaScript includes math operatos, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(` and `)`.

## Data Types

```JavaScript
var {{variableName}} = {{someValue}};

var firstName = 'Xinyang';
```

### Truthy/Falsy

|Truthy|Falsy|
|------|-----|
|true|false|
|non-zero numbers|0|
|"string"|""|
|objects|undefined|
|arrays|null|
|functions|NaN|

NOTE: Truthy evaluates to *true* and falsy evaluates to *false*. Two special numeric values are `Infinity` and `-Infinity`.

`NaN` or Not a Number, is a value that turns up when user ask **JavaScript** to do impossible things in arithmetic. 
(e.g. Deivide zero by zero)

If in double, use strick equal `===` and strict not equal `!==` in situations where truthy or falsy values could lead to logic errors.
These operators ensure that the objects are compared by type and by by value.

[here](http://opensourcehacker.com/2012/10/17/true-lies-and-falsy-values-in-python-and-javascript/).

### Arrays

```JavaScript
var array0 = [item1, item2, item3];

var array1 = ["string",
			  3.1415,
			  {
				"state": false
			  }, 
			  function(){return 0}
			 ];
```

NOTE: Length of array is **NOT** equal to number of elements inside.

### Object

Object contains information and tools. There are no class in **JavaScript**. 

Methods are properties that contains functions.

```JavaScript
skills = ['awesomeness', 'programming', 'JavaScript'];

// JavaScript Object
var bio = {
	'name': 'Xinyang',
	'age': 9999,
	'skills': skills
};

// access to the property with dot notation and bracket notation
var age = bio.age;
var name = bio['name'];

function Car() {}

/*
var Car = function() {}
*/

var car = new Car();
```

NOTE: Dote notation and bracket notation are different with the properties you can access with.

### JSON

**JavaScript Object Notation**, a popular and simple format for storing and transferring nested or hierarchal data.
Internet GET and POST requests frequently pass data in JSON format.
JSON allows for objects to be easily encapsulated within other objects.

NOTE: If you generate JSON by hand, test you code using JSON linter, [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)

## Flow Control

### if Statement

```JavaScript
if (condition) {
	statement;
} else {
	statement;
}
```

### Strick Equality vs. Loose Equality

When use strick equality, `===`, no type conversion is done prior to the comparison. 
If the value are different types, they can never be **true**. 
(e.g. a `String` and a `Number`). 
In order to return **true**, the valuees must be equal and the types must be the same.

Loose equality, `==`, if two values are not the same type, converts to a common type before the comparison.
If the types are the same, no difference between `===` and `==`.

NOTE: **NEVER** use `==` because it is frequent source of bugs.
Read more about equlity comparisons and sameness [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness).

## Loops

> Don't repeat yourself!

### while Loop

```JavaScript
while(condition) {
	statement;
}
```

### for Loop

```JavaScript
for(initialisation; condition; mutator) {
	statement;
}

for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	console.log('Hi!');
}

for(item in object_Or_Array) {
	// item is the INDEX
	statement();
}

var countries = ["China", "India", "Singapore"];
for(country in countries) {
	// console.log(country) --- WRONG
	console.log(countries[country]);
}
```

## Functions

Funcitons in JavaScript are first class objects (means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.). 

Being able to pass logic around an application in the form of a function means itâ€™s possible to move a lot of repetitive code into a library function. It makes it easier to separate the unique pieces of logic from the generally useful logic.

```JavaScript
var myFunc = function(param1, param2) {
	// code goes here
	return returnValue;
}

function myFunc(param1, param2) {
	// code goes here
	return returnvalue;
}
```

NOTE: These are equivalent. Pretty much everything is an **Object** in JavaScript.

## Scope

JavaScript ahs a few concepts of "scope". [Origin Post](http://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/)

## What is Scope?

Scope refers to the current conteact of your code in JavaScript.
It can be globally or locally defined.
Understanding scope is key to writing bulletproof code and being a better developer.

### What is Global Scope?

Before you write a line of JavaScript, you are in the `Global Scope`.

We are accessing jQuery in global scope, we can refer to this acess as the `namespace`.
The namespace is an interchangable word for scope, but usually refers to the highest level scope.

### What is Local Scope?

A local scope refers to any scode defined past the global scope.
There is one global scope and each function defined has its own local scode.

```JavaScript
// Scope A: Global scope here
var myFunc = function() {
	// Scope B: Local scope here
}
```

Any locally scoped items are not visible in the global scope - unless exposed.

### Function Scope

All scopes in JavaScript are created with `Function Scode` only.
They are not created by `for` or `while` loops or expression statements.
**New function is new scope**, that is the rule.

```JavaScript
// Scope A
function(){
	// Scope B
	function() {
		// Scope C
	}
}
```

### Lexical Scope

Function with another function, the inner function has acesss to the scope in the outer function.
This is cannled Lexical Scope or Closure - referred to as Static Scope.

```JavaScript
//Scope A
var myFunc = function() {
	// Scope B
	var name = 'Xinyang';
	var myOtherFunc = function(){
		// Scope C: `name` is accessible here
	}
}
```

Lexical scope is easy to work with, any vairbales/objects/functions defined in it's parent scode are available in the scope chain.
The **ONLY** important thing to remember is that Lexical scope does not work backwards.

### Scope Chain

Scope chains establish the scope for a given function. 
Each functino defined has its own nested scope and any function defined within another function has a local scope which is linked to the outer function - this link is called the **chain**.

When resolving a variable, JavaScript always starts at the innermost scope and searchs outwards until it finds the variable/object/function it was looking for.

### Closures

Closure ties in very closely with Lexical scope.

```JavaScript
var sayHello = function(name) {
	var text = 'hello, ' + name;
	return function(){
		console.log(text);
	}
}

sayHello('Xinyang'); // nothing happens

var helloXinyang = sayHello('Xinyang');
helloXinyang(); // will call the closure and log 'hello, Xinyang'

// Alternatively

sayHello('Xinyang')(); // calls the returned function without arg 
```

### Scope and 'this'

Each scope binds a different value of `this` depending on how the function is invoked.
By default `this` refers to the outer most global object, the `window`.

```JavaScript
var myFunction = function () {
  console.log(this); // this = global, [object Window]
};
myFunction();

var myObject = {};
myObject.myMethod = function () {
  console.log(this); // this = Object { myObject }
};

var nav = document.querySelector('.nav'); // <nav class="nav">
var toggleNav = function () {
  console.log(this); // this = <nav> element
};
nav.addEventListener('click', toggleNav, false);
```

There are problems that we run into when dealing with `this` value. 
even inside the same function the scope can be changed and the `this`value can be changed.

```JavaScript
var nav = document.querySelector('.nav'); // <nav class="nav">
var toggleNav = function () {
  console.log(this); // <nav> element
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(this); // [object Window]
  }, 1000);
};
nav.addEventListener('click', toggleNav, false);
```
